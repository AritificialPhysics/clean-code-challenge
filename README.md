# clean-code-challenge
Sanskar Agrawal's (@SauronTheDarkLord on Telegram) solutions to the problems of Clean Code Challenge, posted daily on t.me/DebuggedBBDU.

Solutions written simultaneously in Python3, C and Java.
The code has been styled and commented to the best of my knowledge.

Java programs use the 1TBS indentation style, while C programs use Allman indentation style.
Python has its own style, defined in PEP-8.

All code written on Sublime Text 3. Compilation and output sampling done using command line tools: gcc, python, and javac. Command execution and output verification
done on Ubuntu Linux 20.04

Repo structure:
Seperate folder for each challenge serial, format: challenge-#<challenge_no>; example: challenge-3.
Each folder contains 3 files for Java, C and Python code, distinguishable by extension. Filenames indicate the primary subject of the problem.
